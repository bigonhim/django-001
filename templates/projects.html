                    Football, a symphony of skill and passion, mesmerizes with its artistry and unity. Yet, 
                    corruption tarnishes its purity, 
                    breeding mistrust and injustice, threatening the game's integrity,
                    and betraying its spirit of fair play.

                    In lines and curves, a logo blooms,
                    A symbol of essence, it silently looms.
                    With colors that dance and shapes that sing,
