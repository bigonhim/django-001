# django
 This project is my first project as I embarked on a journey to learn the great django framework which is capable of accomplishing a lot in today's world.
 I built from scratch a personal portifolio website with django simply to get a gist of the url routing the views part and simply all about starting the django 
 framework and being able to use it to build more powerful web apps and evetually apis which i listen alot about,I was even able to host the website using vercel
 which was one heck of a task.I confidently know I will be building more powerful sites and will get to know a lot about django.
